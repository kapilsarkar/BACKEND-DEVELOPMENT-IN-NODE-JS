//Promises-- helps code readability
//Promises helps in solving the problem of  inversion of control
//In javascript promises are special type of objects that get returned immediately when we call them
//Promises acts as a placeholder for the data we hope to get back some time in future here placeholder means temporary value
//In these Promise object we can attach the functionality we want to execute once the future task is done.
//Once the future task is done the promises wil automatically execute the attached functionality 

//1. How we can create a promise?

//2. How can we consume a promise?

//Promise creation---

//Creation of a promise object is synchronous in nature
//there are three sates of promises-
//1. pending--- when we create a new promise object this is a default state it represent work in progress 
//2. fulfilled--- if the operation is completed successfully
//3. rejected--- if the operation was not successful
