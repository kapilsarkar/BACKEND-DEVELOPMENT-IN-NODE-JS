// In JavaScript, coercion refers to the process of converting a value from one type to another. There are two types of coercion: explicit coercion (also known as type casting) and implicit coercion (also known as type coercion).

// ### 1. Explicit Coercion (Type Casting):

// Explicit coercion occurs when you deliberately convert a value from one type to another using functions or operators designed for that purpose.

// #### Examples:

// ```javascript
// // String to Number
// let strNumber = "123";
// let num = Number(strNumber);

// // Number to String
// let number = 456;
// let str = String(number);

// // Boolean to Number
// let boolValue = true;
// let numValue = Number(boolValue);


// ### 2. Implicit Coercion (Type Coercion):

// Implicit coercion happens automatically when operations between different types are performed. JavaScript tries to convert values to a common type before performing an operation.

//#### Examples:

// ``javascript
// // String and Number concatenation
// let result = "5" + 3; // Result: "53" (String)

// // Addition with string and number
// let sum = "5" - 2; // Result: 3 (Number)
// ```

// In the above examples, JavaScript automatically converts the number `3` to a string when concatenated with the string `"5"`. Similarly, in the second example, it converts the string `"5"` to a number before performing the subtraction operation.

// ### Important Considerations:

// 1. **Truthy and Falsy Values:**
//    - In boolean contexts (e.g., conditions), JavaScript implicitly coerces values to booleans. Values like `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and empty strings (`""`) are considered falsy, while others are truthy.

//     ```javascript
//     if ("hello") {
//       // This block will be executed because "hello" is truthy
//     }
//     ```

// 2. **Loose Equality (`==`) and Strict Equality (`===`):**
//    - The equality operator (`==`) performs type coercion, while the strict equality operator (`===`) does not. It checks both value and type.

//     ```javascript
//     console.log(5 == "5");   // true (coercion)
//     console.log(5 === "5");  // false (no coercion)
//     ```

// Coercion can lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully. It's essential to understand how JavaScript handles types and be explicit when necessary to avoid potential issues.


// Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference â€” type coercion is implicit whereas type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.

// Examples
// JS
// Copy to Clipboard
// const value1 = "5";
// const value2 = 9;
// let sum = value1 + value2;

// console.log(sum);
// In the above example, JavaScript has coerced the 9 from a number into a string and then concatenated the two values together, resulting in a string of 59. JavaScript had a choice between a string or a number and decided to use a string.

// The compiler could have coerced the 5 into a number and returned a sum of 14, but it did not. To return this result, you'd have to explicitly convert the 5 to a number using the Number() method:

// JS
// Copy to Clipboard
// sum = Number(value1) + value2;

//what is coercion---
//whenever we do an operation based on the input we can actually convert the input for operation
//here convert means converting types or type of input
//this conversion can be manually done by us -- this is called explicit typecasting
//or the language based on some certain rules automatically converts the types -- thsi is called implicit typecasting
//the term typecasting also referred as type conversion
//THE IMPLICIT TYPE CONVERSION IS CALLED COERCION



// In JavaScript, coercion refers to the automatic conversion of values from one type to another. This can happen implicitly or explicitly, and it plays a crucial role in various operations and comparisons. There are two types of coercion in JavaScript: implicit coercion and explicit coercion.

// 1. **Implicit Coercion:**
//    Implicit coercion happens automatically when values of different types are used together, such as in operations or comparisons. JavaScript tries to convert one or both of the values to a common type before performing the operation. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

//    ```javascript
//    var number = 5;
//    var stringNumber = "10";

//    // Implicit coercion in addition
//    var result = number + stringNumber; // result will be the string "510"
//    ```

//    In the example above, the number is implicitly coerced into a string, and the concatenation operation is performed.

// 2. **Explicit Coercion:**
//    Explicit coercion, also known as type casting or type conversion, occurs when you intentionally convert a value from one type to another using functions or operators. This is done to ensure that the types are compatible for a specific operation.

//    ```javascript
//    var stringNumber = "10";
//    var number = parseInt(stringNumber);

//    // Explicit coercion in addition
//    var result = number + 5; // result will be the number 15
//    ```

//    Here, `parseInt()` is used to explicitly convert the string to a number before performing the addition.

// It's important to be aware of coercion in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior and bugs in your code. It's often recommended to use explicit coercion when the types of values are known and need to be controlled. Additionally, the `===` (strict equality) operator is often preferred over `==` (abstract equality) to avoid unexpected implicit coercions in comparisons.
